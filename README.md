# Project Introduction:-

The Titanic disaster is one of the most infamous shipwrecks in history. On April 15, 1912, the Titanic sank after colliding with an iceberg, resulting in the deaths of more than 1,500 passengers and crew. This project aims to analyze the passenger data from the Titanic to uncover insights into the factors that influenced survival rates. By performing data cleaning and exploratory data analysis (EDA), we will explore relationships between variables and identify patterns and trends in the data.

# Project Summary:-

This project involves the following steps:
Data Cleaning: Handling missing values, removing duplicates, and transforming data to ensure accuracy and consistency.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Visualizing data to uncover relationships between different variables and identify significant patterns.
Insights and Trends: Analyzing the cleaned data to draw meaningful conclusions about the factors affecting passenger survival rates on the Titanic.

# Business Objective

The primary objective of this project is to gain a deeper understanding of the factors that influenced the survival rates of passengers on the Titanic. By analyzing the dataset, we aim to:

Identify key variables that had a significant impact on survival rates, such as passenger class, age, gender, fare, and embarked port.
Provide visualizations that clearly depict these relationships and trends.
Offer insights that can inform future safety measures and decision-making processes in maritime travel and disaster management.

# Conclusion:-

Through meticulous data cleaning and exploratory data analysis (EDA), we have explored and visualized relationships between various factors such as passenger class, gender, age, fare, and embarkation point, and their impact on survival.

 Key findings from this analysis include:-

# Passenger Class and Survival: 
First-class passengers had a significantly higher survival rate compared to those in second and third class, highlighting the disparity in access to lifeboats and safety.

# Gender and Survival: 
Women had a substantially higher survival rate than men, reflecting the "women and children first" policy during the evacuation.

# Age and Survival:
Younger passengers, particularly children, showed higher survival rates, emphasizing prioritization during the rescue efforts.
# Fare and Survival: 
Higher fares, indicative of wealth and higher class, correlated with better survival chances.
# Embarkation Point and Survival: 
Passengers who embarked from different ports had varying survival rates, potentially linked to the socioeconomic status associated with each port.
